In this project, I delve into a health insurance dataset containing essential information about healthcare coverage and how it affects people. The dataset includes a total of 25,141 records, each representing various aspects of health insurance. These records are a valuable resource for understanding how healthcare utilization, coverage, and outcomes are influenced by different factors.
